#COA Taskforce Take Home Challenge
#Overview
This is my submission for the COA Taskforce Take Home Challenge! This repository contains my solutions for the interactive photo gallery and two coding challenges. Below are the setup instructions and explanations of my approach for each challenge.

#Setup Instructions
Clone Repository: Cloned this repository to my local machine using the git clone <repository_url> commmand
Open in VS Code: Opened the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) by navigating to the repository folder in my terminal and using the command code .
View Interactive Photo Gallery: Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the interactive photo gallery.

#Interactive Photo Gallery
Objective: Implement an interactive photo gallery based on provided Figma designs.

Tools Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Approach:

HTML Structure: Created the necessary HTML elements for the gallery layout and image display.

CSS Styling: Styled the gallery components using CSS to match the Figma designs, ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes.

JavaScript Interactivity: Implemented JavaScript functionality for hover interactions and image navigation as per the design requirements.

#Coding Challenges
#Challenge 1: Array Manipulation
Objective: Determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within an array that sums up to a target.

Approach:

Sliding Window Algorithm: Utilized a sliding window approach to efficiently search for the contiguous subarray.

Pointer Movement: Moved two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the array, to dynamically adjust the window size.

#Challenge 2: String Transformation
Objective: Given a string, transform it based on certain rules.

Approach:

Rule-based Transformation: Implemented logic to apply different transformations based on the length of the string and its divisibility by certain numbers.

Modular Approach: Utilized modulo operations to check divisibility and apply the appropriate transformation.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
